# Scraping
    ###### I had heard of this and wanted to learn it but never done it
        - I really enjoyed this most of it was just basic javascript and pulling the data out of HTML
        - I learned a lot about deciphering HTML fairly easily and finding the necessary information to share the data I wanted.
# NPM Packages
    ###### Used axios again. 
        - Its super simple and easy to use and understand although I'm sure I'm just using the basic stuff
        - This was my first runin with headers though and setting them accordingly.
    ######  JSDOM
        - Super simple setup as well. Easy to bring the HTML to the backend.
